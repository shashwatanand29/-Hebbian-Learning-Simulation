This repository contains a MATLAB simulation of Hebbian Learning, a fundamental learning principle in neuroscience, often summarized as "cells that fire together, wire together." Hebbian Learning is a type of unsupervised learning in which the strength of connections between neurons increases as they are activated simultaneously.

The provided MATLAB code demonstrates how neural connections can be adjusted based on the activation patterns of input and output neurons. This simulation provides an intuitive understanding of how neural networks adapt and evolve based on experience, mimicking the learning process in biological systems.

Additionally, the repository includes visualizations of neuron weights and activity to help users better understand the dynamics of Hebbian Learning. You can modify the parameters to explore different learning scenarios and outcomes.

Whether you're studying neural networks or experimenting with learning algorithms, this repository offers a clear introduction to Hebbian Learning in MATLAB. Contributions and modifications are welcome!
